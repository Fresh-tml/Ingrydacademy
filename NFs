How to build an NFS server
Setting up an NFS (Network File System) server allows you to share directories and files with other machines over a network. Here's a basic guide to building an NFS server on a Linux system:

Step 1: Install NFS Server Packages
Ensure that the NFS server packages are installed on your machine. The package names may vary depending on your Linux distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install them using:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
Step 2: Configure Exports
Define which directories you want to share by configuring the exports file. Open the /etc/exports file and add entries for the directories you want to share:

sudo nano /etc/exports
Add lines like this:

/path/to/shared_directory client_ip(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
Replace /path/to/shared_directory with the actual path of the directory you want to share and client_ip with the IP address or subnet of the client machine. The options rw (read-write), sync, and no_subtree_check are common options.

Save the file and exit.

Step 3: Restart NFS Server
Restart the NFS server to apply the changes:

sudo service nfs-kernel-server restart

Step 4: Configure Firewall (if necessary)
If you are using a firewall, make sure to allow NFS traffic. For example, on Ubuntu with UFW:

sudo ufw allow from client_ip to any port nfs
sudo ufw enable

Step 5: Mounting NFS Shares on Clients
On the client machines, you can mount the shared directory using the mount command. For example:

sudo mount server_ip:/path/to/shared_directory /mnt/local_mount_point
Replace server_ip, /path/to/shared_directory, and /mnt/local_mount_point with your server's IP, shared directory path, and the local mount point on the client.
